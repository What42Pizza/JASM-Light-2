This is how the clock in JASM Comp 3 will work.
Created 09/04/20



First off, the 'clock' will just be a signal that propagates through different components to control the CPU.



Load byte 1:
1: Send PC to JDI Address.
2: Set JDI continue point to 'Finish byte 1'.
3: Activate JDI Read.

Finish byte 1:
1: Send JDI Data to Instruction Register.
2: See if Instruction Register's bit 7 is on.
If it is: Go to 'Load byte 2'
If it isn't: Go to 'Execute instruction'

Load byte 2:
1: Increment PC.
2: Send PC to JDI Address.
3: Set JDI continue point to 'Finish byte 2'.
4: Activate JDI Read.

Finish byte 2:
1: Send JDI Data to Data Register 1.
2: Go to 'Execute instruction'.

Execute instruction:
1: Set JDI continue point to 'return to opcode'.
2: Activate Decoder. (execute instruction; opcode will return to 'Finish instruction')

Finish instruction:
1: If Block Inc Flag isn't set, increment PC.
2: Reset Block Inc Flag.
3: If Stop Flag isn't set, go to 'Load byte 1'.
