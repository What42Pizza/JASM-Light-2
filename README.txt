# JASM-Light-2
This is everything about my assembly language JASM Light 2. It has details about the language and some simple emulators (just the source made with processing 3) that can run JASM programs.

This language is designed to be easy to build a computer for. Every time you go up a version, building a computer for it becomes a bit harder. Also, the reason this is JASM Light 2 is because JASM Light 1 became too feature-creeped for me to build a computer to run it.
