020 AND ---   Stes register C to register A bitwise and register B.
021 ORR ---   Sets register C to register A bitwise or register B.
022 NOT ---   Sets register C to bitwise not register A.
023 XOR ---   Sets register C to register A bitwise xor register B.
024 SCA ---   Sets the carry flag.
025 RCA ---   Resets the carry flag.
026 STP ---   Stops execution.

Conditional jumps data:

All bits:
1 Required
1 Required
- Num of data registers (0: 1 reg, 1: both regs)
- Condition inverted (0: no, 1: yes)
- Condition type bit 3
- Condition type bit 2
- Condition type bit 1
- Condition type bit 0

Lowest 4 bits (define condition):
0: Jump if A == B
1: Jump if A > B
2: Jump if A < B
3: Jump if A = 0
4: Jump if C = 0
5: Jump if addition overflow
6: Jump if subtraction underflow
7: Jump if shift overflow
8: Jump if shift underflow
9: Jump if carry flag set
